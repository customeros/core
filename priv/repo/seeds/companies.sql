#### _I''ve had the privilege of working with amazing clients, producing work to be proud of._

Craig Cannings

We inherited a set of extension plans when we bought our house, which initially we were happy with and intended to go ahead and build. Richie took one look and immediately recommended some changes which transformed something very basic into a much more modern and practical living space - ultimately these changes have been the highlight of the end result of our build. It’s the first time that we’ve been through this process and Richie was very supportive and responsive throughout. We would 100% recommend! Craig and Claire

Our first time working with RT Architects. Richie has been amazing from start to finish, nothing is too much trouble and he has guided us through the process of designing our extension and house renovations perfectly. Always quick to come back with any design tweaks we needed and answer any questions we may have. Could not recommend RT Architects highly enough!

Rich of RT ARCHITECTS worked with my thoughts and ideas for an open plan extension to my 1930s dorma bungalow. He was very easy to work with, bringing it all to fruition, and keeping it modern but sympathetic to the original building. All planning, building regulations and calculations for the new extension were all done and submitted alongside any site meetings required. Professional, smart and with a very good understanding of all aspects of the process. Rich worked very well alongside my builder making the whole experience and final finished extension the house of my dreams.

When we started the process with RT Architects everything was just easy. Richie listened to what we wanted and helped make our ideas a reality. He handled the planning submission and building regulation requirements efficiently, handling any questions raised during the process quickly. Our extension is now watertight with internal works underway and we couldn’t have got this far without him. I would highly recommend RT Architects to everyone

I cannot recommend RT Architects more highly, Richie sorted absolutely everything. Anything extra the council required Richie sorted without having to trouble me. If you are planning to apply for any planning look no further.. Extremely happy clients.

We had the pleasure of working with RT Architects to help re-design our first house. We knew we wanted walls moving here and there etc but had no idea where to start. From the very beginning Rich was incredible, he listened to us and what we wanted and helped input things we hadn''t thought of. He was extremely professional and every interaction went smoothly. Everything was explained along the way and nothing was too much trouble, he helped put us at ease for quite a big daunting job. Couldn''t have done it without him. Would absolutely highly recommend.

OUR STORY

Founded in Reading in 2017 as a street food and catering business, after successfully building a following at local markets and events we went on to launch our first restaurant in Caversham in October 2019.

After falling in love with the south coast and all it offers, in February 2024 we took the exciting move of doubling up and opened our second restaurant on Bourne Avenue, Bournemouth.

Our mission is to improve the world around us through spreading the joys of a healthier and more sustainable diet. Our focus is on making nourishing but indulgent food and the food we make is from scratch, never deep fried, and always 100% plant based meaning vegetables really are the stars of the show!

It goes without saying that our impact on the environment is always on our minds and we strive to minimise that impact as far as possible in every area of our business from using environmentally friendly energy suppliers to using recycled wood in our furniture down to the basics of ensuring all of our takeaway packaging is at least 100% compostable.

We are also passionate about keeping our supply chain as local as possible and are proud to list the likes of local coffee roasters, veg suppliers, bakers, craft breweries, wineries, and social enterprises amongst our growing list of wonderful suppliers.
